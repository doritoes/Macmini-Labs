# Install Supported Browser
No major browsers support macOS High Sierra any more (the latest version that runs on my lab hardward). Firefox ESR does, though!

## Installing Firefox ESR
- Google search "install firefox mac" and/or navigate to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mac/
- You will be notified that your OS version is not supported, and you will be seamlessly redirected to install the ESR edition "Firefox Extended Support Release".
- Download Firefox
- After completing the download, the file (Firefox.dmg) may open a Finder window containing the Firefox application
- Drag the Firefox icon to the Applications folder
- See more information at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-download-and-install-firefox-mac
  - how to eject the dmg file
  - how to add Firefox to your dock
- Compare the speedtest.net resuts with Safari
