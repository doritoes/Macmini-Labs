# Linux Server Testing
In this step, we will be installing Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS and putting it through its paces.

It's very easy to install Ubuntu Server on the mini. I actually used the very same USB stick I used to install on Intel NUCs to install Ubuntu on the mini.
- Download Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS ISO
- Create a bootable USB stick using Balena Etcher
- Power off the Mac mini
- Insert the bootable USB stick
- Power on then immediately hold Option key (Alt key on Windows keyboard)
- Select the EFI boot image
- Follow the usual prompts
