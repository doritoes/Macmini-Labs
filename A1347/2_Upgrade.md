# Upgrade RAM and Storage
I recommend upgrading the RAM to 8GB (2x 4GB modules):
- DDR3 1066 MHz and 1.5V to work
- Using 1.35V or faster DDR RAM will result in failure to boot

The storage drive can be replaced with a 2.5" SSD of your choice.
- The 2010 Mac Mini has a SATA ll G3 controller, so you will need to make sure that whatever drive you select (SSD or HDD) is compatible or backwards compatible to SATA ll 3G.
- Reportedly utilizes SATA2 but see,s to perform at SATA1 speeds due to controller issues.
- Samsung or Crucial are recommended brands

Requirements:
- Mac Mini toolkit
- If you are replacing the storage, you will need a bootable MacOS High Sierra USB stick
