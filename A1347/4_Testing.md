How to benchmark your Macâ€™s CPU
- To check your processor speed we recommend Geekbench from Primate Labs. Geekbench is free to use and you can get it on the Mac App Store here. You can also download it from Primate Labs website here. 

Check for issues
- use Disk Utility First Aid to check the integrity of the file system.   I highly recommend running First Aid on the hidden Container which can be revealed within Disk Utility by clicking on "View" within Disk Utility and selecting "Show All Devices".   Even if First Aid shows everything is "Ok" click "Show Details" and look for any unfixed errors or warnings. 
- download and install EtreCheck - "Default problem: Computer is too slow"
