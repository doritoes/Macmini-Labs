# Linux Desktop Testing
In this step, we will be installing Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS and putting it through its paces.

It's very easy to install Ubuntu Desktop on the mini. I actually used the very same USB stick I used to install on Intel NUCs to install Ubuntu on the mini.
- Download Ubuntu Live Desktop 22.04 LTS ISO
- Create a bootable USB stick using Balena Etcher
- Power off the Mac mini
- Insert the bootable USB stick
- Power on then immediately hold Option key (Alt key on Windows keyboard)
- Select the EFI boot image
- Follow the usual prompts

*See more comments at https://medium.com/@woodywang2013/linux-on-an-old-mac-mini-f8cb63b7657f*

IMPORTANT Lab testing ran into a few scenarios where after first boot the main graphics pane was corrupted with RAM artifacts and ghosting. Installing 3rd party drivers during setup was the most common cause. A package update and reboot solved the issue in all cases.

## Install from Bootable USB Stick
See the tutorial https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview
- Download the [latest ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- Create a bootable USB stick from the ISO
  - ðŸ’¡[balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) is recommended to create a bootable USB stick from the ISO
  - If your workstation is Windows, the Portable version is perfect for the task
  - Click **Flash from file** and select the downloaded ISO file
  - Click **Select target** and select the the USB stick you inserted
  - Click **Flash!** and allow the command shell to continue
  - Wait for the flash and verification to complete
  - Safely eject the USB stick (yes, there are two "drives" on the USB stick) ([tip](Appendix_Safely_Eject.md))
- Option-boot the mini from the bootable USB stick
  - Connect to keyboard, mouse and power
    - Optionally connect to wired network for faster setup
  - Insert the USB stick
  - Reboot or power on the mini
  - Press and hold Option
  - Select the USB stick (USB UEFI)
- Follow the prompts to install Ubuntu on the mini
  - Allow the system to come up to the "Install" screen and click **Install Ubuntu**
  - Accept the keyboard settings
  - Configure the wifi connection now (if you are wired, you won't be prompted; set it up later)
  - There is no wrong answer for the packages screen; accept the defaults or modify as desired
  - Select **Erase disk and install Ubuntu**
  - Click **Install Now**
  - Click **Continue** and write changes to disk
  - Accept the time zone settings
  - Enter system and user information *you can modify these as desired*
    - Name: **mini**
    - Computer name: **mini1**
    - Username: **tux**
    - Password: **tux**
    - Require password to log in
    - Continue
  - Wait patiently for the **Installation Complete** message
  - Click **Restart Now**
  - Remove the USB stick when prompted and press Enter

ðŸ’¡ You cannot SSH to mini1 at this point.

## Update Pacakges
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

## Allow Remote Access

  - https://notepadqq.com/wp/download/
  - `sudo apt install notepadqq`

## Install LAMP Environment
LAMP = Linux Apache MySQL PHP

Here are 2 ways to set up the LAMP environment. They both point to the same web root data and same mysql data on the system/

- Install all the pieces manually
  - `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y lamp-server^'`
    - The carrot is there on purpose and is important
    - Alternative: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql`
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu
  - Make index.php the default index page
    - ``sudo vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf``
    - move index.php to be the first item after DirectoryIndex
      - i.e., `DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm`
  - Test PHP processing
    - copy this file to /var/www/html/
      - [index.php](index.php)
  - Restart Web server
    - `sudo systemctl restart apache2`
  - Load the page to test php processing
    - http://127.0.0.1
    - should show the phpinfo() detailed output
- Use a Docker image
  - https://medium.com/@mikez_dg/how-to-set-up-a-simple-lamp-server-with-docker-images-in-2023-9b0e24476ec6
  - Install docker if needed
    - `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl`
    - `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`
    - `sudo sh ./get-docker.sh --dry-run`
    - `sudo sh ./get-docker.sh`
  - Create a project directory
    - `mkdir lamp-docker && cd lamp-docker`
  - Create the file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
  - If /var/www/html doesn't exist yet
    - `sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html`
  - Put your web application or HTML files inside it
    - If you don't have any files handy, put a copy of [index.php](index.php) there; it will display the output of phpinfo()
  - Build and run the containers
    - Install docker-compose
        - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-22-04
        - `mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/`
        - `curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.3.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose`
        - `chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose`
        - `sudo ln -s ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose /usr/sbin`
        - `docker-compose version`
    - `sudo docker-compose up -d`
  - Test access:
    - Web site: http://localhost
    - PHPMyAdmin: http://localhost:8080
      - credentials are in the docker-compose.yml file

## Dokuwiki
Dokuwiki is an open source wiki that is a good demonstration. However, it does not use the MySQL database
- https://download.dokuwiki.org/
  - optionally remove unwanted language packages
  - optionally add Upgrade Plug-In
  - Click Download
- Open Terminal
- Copy the downloaded .tgz file to the web root
  - `sudo cp Downloads/dokuwiki*tgz /var/www/html`
- Unpack the tgz file
  - `cd /var/www/html`
  - `sudo tar xzvf dokuwiki-[tab complete]`
- Set permissions
  - `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/dokuwiki`
- Run the Dokuwiki installation wizard
  - http://127.0.0.1/dokuwiki/install.php
- Clean up
  - delete the install.php file from the /var/www/dokuwiki folder
  - delete the .tgz file from the /var/www/html folder
- Access the wiki at http://127.0.0.1/dokuwiki/

## Install LAMP Apps
### Simple-LAMP
WARNING If you configured strong password requirements when you ran `mysql_secure_installation`, you will need to use something stronger than "password" in the command below and in the config.php file. "Password1234!" works.

IMPORTANT - currently the database only accepts unix sockets, so the connection for 'username' fails.
~~~

  PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=11 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
~~~
  - `exit`
  - WARNING If you ran `mysql_secure_installation` you will want to run this:
    - `ALTER USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password by `Password1234!';`
    - and update the config.php file to use the same password `Password1234!`
  - `sudo mysql -u root -p simple_lamp < simple_lamp.sql`
   - press enter (no password) when prompted for the mysql password for root

- You can now access the app from another Lab system by using the IP address of the mini
  - example: http://192.168.0.100/simple-lamp

### YOURLS
This is a URL shortener service app that exercises the MySQL database.

https://yourls.org/docs - https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS
- Web Server: YOURLS requires Apache (httpd) version 2.4 or greater, with the mod_rewrite module enabled.
- PHP: PHP version 7.4 or greater is required for YOURLS to function correctly.
- If you plan on utilizing the YOURLS API, make sure the PHP cURL extension is enabled.
- Database: YOURLS supports either MySQL (version 5.0 or greater) or MariaDB (version 10.0 or greater) for storing link data.
- HTTPS Support: For security reasons, we recommend hosting your YOURLS installation on a server with HTTPS support.

Steps:
- Change directory to the html root
  - `cd /var/www/html`
- Clone the repo
  - https://github.com/qyjohn/simple-lamp
  - `sudo git clone https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS`
- Set permissions
  - `sudo chown www-data:www-data -R /var/www/html/YOURLS`
- Create the MySQL database and user
  - `sudo mysql`
~~~
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS yourls;
CREATE DATABASE yourls;
DROP USER IF EXISTS 'yourls'@'localhost';
CREATE USER 'yourls'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yourls.* TO 'yourls'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
~~~
- Create config file
  - Copy /var/www/html/YOURLS/user/config-sample.php to /var/www/html/YOURLS/user/config.php
  - Edit 
  - Edit the YOURLS_DB_USER value to `yourls` (in production you would add another user for YOURLS)
  - Edit the YOURLS_DB_PASS to the password we above (i.e. `password` unless you had to use another password because you secured your mysql installation)
  - Modify YOURLS_SITE to the URL you will use to access the site
    - e.g., http://192.168.99.100/YOURLS or docker http://192.168.99.100:8080/YOURLS
    - if you don't change this setting you will get a hilarious error message
  - Optionally modify the default admin credentials of: username/password
- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1/YOURLS/admin
  - or docker http://127.0.0.1:8080/YOURLS/admin
- Click **Install YOURLS**
- Click the link to the admin page
- Log in (credentials in config.php, default: username/password)
- Optionally create a web page the home directory that non-admins will see (e.g., /var/www/html/YOURLS/index.php)
- Remove the unneeded files from the YOURLS directory, such as "setup.php", "readme.html", the sample files, the git folders, etc.
