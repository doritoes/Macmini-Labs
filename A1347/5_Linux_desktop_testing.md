# Linux Desktop Testing
In this step, we will be installing Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS and putting it through its paces.

It's very easy to install Ubuntu Desktop on the mini. I actually used the very same USB stick I used to install on Intel NUCs to install Ubuntu on the mini.
- Download Ubuntu Live Desktop 22.04 LTS ISO
- Create a bootable USB stick using Balena Etcher
- Power off the Mac mini
- Insert the bootable USB stick
- Power on then immediately hold Option key (Alt key on Windows keyboard)
- Select the EFI boot image
- Follow the usual prompts

*See more comments at https://medium.com/@woodywang2013/linux-on-an-old-mac-mini-f8cb63b7657f*

IMPORTANT Lab testing ran into a few scenarios where after first boot the main graphics pane was corrupted with RAM artifacts and ghosting. Installing 3rd party drivers during setup was the most common cause. A package update and reboot solved the issue in all cases.

## Install from Bootable USB Stick
See the tutorial https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview
- Download the [latest ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- Create a bootable USB stick from the ISO
  - ðŸ’¡[balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) is recommended to create a bootable USB stick from the ISO
  - If your workstation is Windows, the Portable version is perfect for the task
  - Click **Flash from file** and select the downloaded ISO file
  - Click **Select target** and select the the USB stick you inserted
  - Click **Flash!** and allow the command shell to continue
  - Wait for the flash and verification to complete
  - Safely eject the USB stick (yes, there are two "drives" on the USB stick) ([tip](Appendix_Safely_Eject.md))
- Option-boot the mini from the bootable USB stick
  - Connect to keyboard, mouse and power
    - Optionally connect to wired network for faster setup
  - Insert the USB stick
  - Reboot or power on the mini
  - Press and hold Option
  - Select the USB stick (USB UEFI)
- Follow the prompts to install Ubuntu on the mini
  - Allow the system to come up to the "Install" screen and click **Install Ubuntu**
  - Accept the keyboard settings
  - Configure the wifi connection now (if you are wired, you won't be prompted; set it up later)
  - There is no wrong answer for the packages screen; accept the defaults or modify as desired
  - Select **Erase disk and install Ubuntu**
  - Click **Install Now**
  - Click **Continue** and write changes to disk
  - Accept the time zone settings
  - Enter system and user information *you can modify these as desired*
    - Name: **mini**
    - Computer name: **mini1**
    - Username: **tux**
    - Password: **tux**
    - Require password to log in
    - Continue
  - Wait patiently for the **Installation Complete** message
  - Click **Restart Now**
  - Remove the USB stick when prompted and press Enter

ðŸ’¡ You cannot SSH to mini1 at this point.

## Allow Remote Access
- Allow ssh
  - `sudo apt update && sudo apt install openssh-server -y`
- Allow remote desktop
  - See https://askubuntu.com/questions/1482111/remote-desktop-ubuntu-22-04-lts
  - Settings > Sharing
  - Enable the Sharing slider
  - Click Remote Desktop
  - Enable Remote Desktop
  - Enable Remote Control
  - Only Enable Legacy VNC Protocol if you must
  - Under authentication, confirm the username <ins>and password</ins>
    - a random password is set; you might want to change it to something more memorable  
  - BEWARE that remote desktop is disabled when the screen is locked
    - see https://askubuntu.com/questions/1411504/connect-when-remote-desktop-is-on-login-screen-or-screen-locked-without-autolog
    - there are workarounds

## Install Code Editor
- VS Code
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
- Notepadqq
  - https://notepadqq.com/wp/download/
  - `sudo apt install notepadqq`

## Install LAMP Environment
LAMP = Linux Apache MySQL PHP

- Install all the pieces manually
  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu
- Use a Docker image
  - https://medium.com/@mikez_dg/how-to-set-up-a-simple-lamp-server-with-docker-images-in-2023-9b0e24476ec6
  - Install docker if needed
    - if you qualify for Docker Desktop (beware the licensing changes!): https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/
    - otherwise https://gcore.com/learning/how-to-install-docker-ubuntu/
  - Create a project directory
    - `mkdir lamp-docker && cd lamp-docker`
  - Create the file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
  - Create the html directory and put your web application or HTML files inside it
    - `mkdir html`
    - If you don't have any files handy, put a copy of [index.php](index.php) there; it will display the output of phpinfo()
  - Build and run the containers
    - `docker-compose up -d`
  - Test access:
    - Web site: http://localhost
    - PHPMyAdmin: http://localhost:8080
      - credentials are in the docker-compose.yml file

## Dokuwiki
Dokuwiki is an open source wiki that is a good demonstration. However, it does not use the mySQL database
- https://download.dokuwiki.org/
  - optionally remove unwanted language packages
  - optionally add Upgrade Plugin
  - Click Download
- Open Terminal
- Copy the downloaded .tgz file to the htdocs directory
  - Example if your volume is named macOS
  - `cp Downloads/docuwiki*tgz _________________`
- Unpack the tgz file
  - Example if your volume is named macOS
  - `cd ______________________`
  - `tar xzvf dokuwiki-[tab complete]`
- Run the Dokuwiki installation wizard
  - http://127.0.0.1:8888/dokuwiki/install.php
- Clean up
  - delete the install.php file from the dokuwiki folder
  - delete the .tgz file from the htdocs folder
- Access the wiki at http://127.0.0.1:8888/dokuwiki/

## Install LAMP Apps
### Simple-LAMP
- https://github.com/qyjohn/simple-lamp
- Open Terminal
- Change directory to the htdocs directory
  - Example if your volume is named macOS
  - `cd Volumes/macOS/Applications/MAMP/htdocs`
- Clone the repo
  - https://github.com/qyjohn/simple-lamp
  - `git clone https://github.com/qyjohn/simple-lamp`
- Normally we would use `mysql` client to do the initial configuration. However, the mysq-client failed to build/install on High Sierra
- Create `install.php` file to perform the same options
  - [install.php](install.php)
- Configure the app:
  - http://127.0.0.1:8888/simple-lamp/install.php
- Access the app:
  - http://127.0.0.1:8888/simple-lamp/
- You can now access the app from another Lab system by using the IP address of the mini
  - example: http://192.168.0.100:8888/simple-lamp
- It's best practice to remove the `install.php` file after isntallation to prevent overwriting the database

### YOURLS
This is a URL shortener service app that exercises the MySQL database.

https://yourls.org/docs - https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS
- Web Server: YOURLS requires Apache (httpd) version 2.4 or greater, with the mod_rewrite module enabled.
- PHP: PHP version 7.4 or greater is required for YOURLS to function correctly.
- If you plan on utilizing the YOURLS API, make sure the PHP cURL extension is enabled.
- Database: YOURLS supports either MySQL (version 5.0 or greater) or MariaDB (version 10.0 or greater) for storing link data.
- HTTPS Support: For security reasons, we recommend hosting your YOURLS installation on a server with HTTPS support.

Steps:
- Change directory to the htdocs directory
  - Example if your volume is named macOS
  - `cd Volumes/macOS/Applications/MAMP/htdocs`
- Clone the repo
  - https://github.com/qyjohn/simple-lamp
  - `git clone https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS`
- Create the MySQL database and user
  - Create `setup.php` file in htdocs/YOURLS/setup.php
  - [setup.php](setup.php)
  - http://localhost:8888/YOURLS/setup.php
- Create config file
  - Copy htdocs/YOURLS/user/config-sample.php to htdocs/YOURLS/user/config.php
  - Edit the YOURLS_DB_USER value to `yourls` (in production you would add another user for YOURLS)
  - Edit the YOURLS_DB_PASS to `password` (see the setup.php file)
  - Modify YOURLS_SITE to the URL you will use to access the site
    - e.g., http://192.168.99.100:8888/YOURLS
    - if you don't change this setting you will get a hilarious error message
  - Optionally modify the default admin credentials of: username/password
- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8888/YOURLS/admin
- Click Install YOURLS
- Click the link to the admin page
- Log in (credentials in config.php)
- Optionally create a web page the home directory that non-admins will see (e.g., htdocs/YOURLS/index.php)
- Remove the uneeded files from the YOURLS directory, such as "setup.php", "readme.html", the sample files, the git folders, etc.
