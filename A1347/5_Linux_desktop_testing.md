# Linux Desktop Testing
In this step, we will be installing Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS and putting it through its paces.


It's very easy to install Ubuntu Desktop on the mini. I actually used the very same USB stick I used to install on Intel NUCs to install Ubuntu on the mini.
- Download Ubuntu Live Desktop 22.04 LTS ISO
- Create a bootable USB stick using Balena Etcher
- Power off the Mac mini
- Insert the bootable USB stick
- Power on then immediately hold Option key (Alt key on Windows keyboard)
- Select the EFI boot image
- Follow the usual prompts
